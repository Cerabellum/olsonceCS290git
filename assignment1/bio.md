Assignment 1
5 April 2015

General Background:
	My name is Cera Olson. I completed my first Bachelor’s in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Oregon State in June of 2013. At the same time, I commissioned as an Army Officer through the Army ROTC program. Since then, I have been working as a Communications Officer in Georgia and working to finish up this Bachelor’s in Computer Science. My second Bachelor’s should be completed by the end of this summer. My educational interests include Cryptography, Signal Processing, and Linguistics. I am hoping to start my Master’s in the fall in Cyber Security. I eventually want to pursue a Ph.D. in Cybersecurity. 
	Outside of school, I ride horses, run, and keep up practice in 5 different languages. My horse’s name is Jer’Czey. She is a 6 year old Belgian Warmblood.
