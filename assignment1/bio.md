Cera Olson
CS 290
Assignment 1
5 April 2015

General Background:
	My name is Cera Olson. I completed my first Bachelor’s in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Oregon State in June of 2013. At the same time, I commissioned as an Army Officer through the Army ROTC program. Since then, I have been working as a Communications Officer in Georgia and working to finish up this Bachelor’s in Computer Science. My second Bachelor’s should be completed by the end of this summer. My educational interests include Cryptography, Signal Processing, and Linguistics. I am hoping to start my Master’s in the fall in Cyber Security. I eventually want to pursue a Ph.D. in Cybersecurity. 
	Outside of school, I ride horses, run, and keep up practice in 5 different languages. My horse’s name is Jer’Czey. She is a 6 year old Belgian Warmblood. 


Programming Background:

	Most of my programming background comes from ECE classes at Oregon State. My favorite project was working with different cryptographic algorithms in a class with Kevin McGrath. CS 311 taught me more about programming than any of the classes before it and really showed me what I was missing.
