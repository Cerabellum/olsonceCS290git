Cera Olson
CS 290
Assignment 1
5 April 2015

General Background:
	My name is Cera Olson. I completed my first Bachelor’s in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Oregon State in June of 2013. At the same time, I commissioned as an Army Officer through the Army ROTC program. Since then, I have been working as a Communications Officer in Georgia and working to finish up this Bachelor’s in Computer Science. My educational interests include Cryptography, Signal Processing, and Linguistics. I am hoping to start my Master’s in the fall in Cyber Security. I eventually want to pursue a Ph.D. in either Cyber Security or Computational Linguistics. Outside of school, I ride horses, run, keep up practice in 5 different languages. My horse’s name is Jer’Czey. She is a 5 year old Belgian Warmblood. I am hoping to compete her in her first show by the end of the year.  


Programming Background:
	Most of my programming background comes from ECE classes at Oregon State. My favorite project was working with different cryptographic algorithms in a class with Kevin McGrath. CS 311 taught me more about programming than any of the classes before it and really showed me what I was missing.

	Languages, Descending by Familiarity:
		Python
